# PathParser
PathParser is a python-based computational tool for the thermodynamics and robustness analysis of native and designed metabolic pathways. The following functionalities are provided:   
1 Max-min driving force (MDF) optimization. The Gibbs free energy change of the least favorable reaction will be maximized to evaluate thermodynamic feasibility of the entire pathway.
